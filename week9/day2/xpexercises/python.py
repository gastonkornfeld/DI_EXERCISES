# Exercise 1 : Built-In Functions
# Python has many built-in functions, and if you do not know how to use it, you can read document online.
# But Python has a built-in document function for every built-in functions.

# Write a program to print some Python built-in functions documents, such as abs(), int(), raw_input().
# And add documentation for your own function


def help_for_abs_int_and_raw_input():
    print(f"abs function: \n {help(abs)} \n int function:\n {help(int)}  \n raw_input:\n {help(input)}")
