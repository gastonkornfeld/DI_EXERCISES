<p>Doctor Stephen Strange is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by
    Marvel Comics. Created by artist Steve Ditko and writer Stan Lee, the character first appeared
    in Strange Tales #110 (cover-dated July 1963). Doctor Strange serves as the Sorcerer Supreme, the
    primary protector of Earth against magical and mystical threats. Inspired by stories of black magic
    and Chandu the Magician, Strange was created during the Silver Age of Comic Books to bring a different
    kind of character and themes of mysticism to Marvel Comics.</p>
