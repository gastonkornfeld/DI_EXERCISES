# Note: For this exercise, we will use the JSON database provided in the assets below.

# This database contains a list of dictionnaries. Each dictionnary contains these keys:


# We will be using these keys to represent each item in our marketplace.
# You donâ€™t have to use all the keys.

# Build a marketplace website, the website should have 3 pages:
# A homepage, with a welcome message, routed to /.
# A products page, that displays a list of all the products that are for sale, routed to /products.
# A product details page, that displays the detail of the selected product
#  (the product id should be passed into the URL), routed to /product/<product_id>
